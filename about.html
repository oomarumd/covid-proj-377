            <h2>About the Project</h2>
            <p class="center">As students in a web development class at the University of Maryland, we've been learning how to create cool websites. 
                This site you're on right now is our final project, showing off what we've learned.
                 But it's not just for gradesâ€”it's also our way of tackling a big problem: COVID-19.</p>
            <p class="center">Our goal with this website is to help people understand COVID-19 better. 
                We use special tools called APIs to gather data about the virus from all over the world. 
                Then, we organize that data in easy-to-read charts and graphs. So, whether you're curious 
                about how many cases there are in your country or want to see how the virus is spreading globally, 
                you can find the answers here. It's like a one-stop-shop for COVID-19 info!</p>
